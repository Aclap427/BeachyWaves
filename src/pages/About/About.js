                    Beachy Waves Hair Salon is the brain child of owner Alexa Claproth.
                    Alexa has been in the hair industry for over 8 years,
                    and finally took a chance to open her own salon!
                    She has had such a fun time transforming the
                    building into her vision. It's still a work in
                    progress and Covid has thrown a wrench in her plans,
                    but it's still coming together beautifully due to her
                    determination and overall badassery. <br />
                    <br />
                    To keep up with the latest improvements, Covid changes 
                    and of course to see Alexa's latest masterpieces, follow the salon
